# Rust on Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)

Some practice projects I'm doing to learn Embedded rust on a Raspberry Pi Pico board.

The projects are using the [Embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main) framework and are based on the [rp-pico-template](https://github.com/diegoasanch/rp-pico-template), focusing on a specific topic each.
